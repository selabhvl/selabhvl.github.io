Software engineering and how we develop software play a still more critical role for system development as software technology is becoming pervasive across all areas of society and industry.
Software engineering is concerned with the concepts, principles, methods and software tools used in the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance of software and IT systems.

> Our research activities encompass theoretical foundations, software development tools and technology, and implementation and evaluation of software system prototypes.

The group has a particular strong research track record in the areas of model-driven software engineering, concurrent and distributed systems, software verification and testing, software quality and security, code refactoring, and software architecture.

Our research group is involved in several projects in the areas of health-care, embedded systems, robotics and industrial automation, internet-of-things and cloud computing services, machine learning, and automotive software systems.

Furthermore, we have research collaboration with many national and international research institutions, and several national and international companies:
the University of Extremadura (ES), the [University of L체beck (DE)](https://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de), University of Oslo (NO), [the University of Stavanger (NO)](https://www.ux.uis.no/~meling/), and [the University of Torino (IT)](https://www.cs.unito.it/do/home.pl).

## Software Releases

Below, you can find a list of our software development efforts and tools that we have released as part of our work and publishing:

<!-- TODO: provide as CVS in _data -->

* [**BPMN Analyzer**: Formal analysis of BPMN process models](https://timkraeuter.com/bpmn-analyzer/) ([Github](https://github.com/timKraeuter/Rewrite_Rule_Generation)) [[Article](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=2164613) (preprint)], Tim Kr채uter et al.
  <details><summary>The BPMN Analyzer is an open-source tool to analyze BPMN process models formally.</summary><p>The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard notation for defining intra- and inter-organizational workflows. It is used heavily for process automation and orchestration in many businesses. Formalizing BPMN reduces the cost of business process automation by facilitating the detection of errors and optimization potentials in process models already during design time before the implementation starts. </p></details>
* [**Visual Debugger**: Extending IDEs with visual debugging capabilities](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16851-visual-debugger) ([Github](https://github.com/timKraeuter/VisualDebugger)) [[Article](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=2095639) (preprint)], Tim Kr채uter et al.
* [**CorrLang**](https://www.corrlang.io/) ([Github](https://github.com/webminz/corr-lang)) [[Article](https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/2837740)], Patrick St체nkel
* **RplTools** ([Github](https://github.com/razi236/Rpl-Tools)] [[Article](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=2213248)], Muhammad Rizwan Ali et al.
* **DYNAMIC** Fire risk indicator implementation ([Github](https://github.com/selabhvl/dynamic-frcm)), Lars Michael Kristensen et al. Implementation of the dynamic fire risk indicator
* [**MBT/CPN**: Model-based Testing with Coloured Petri Nets]() ([Github](https://github.com/selabhvl/mbtcpn)) [[Article](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=1645457)], Rui Wang et al.
  <details><summary>MBT/CPN is a tool for model-based testing with Coloured Petri Nets.</summary><p> The tool is used as a library on top of CPN Tools and requires installation of CPN Tools.</p></details>
* **COEMS Race Checker** ([Github](https://github.com/selabhvl/coems-racechecker)) [[Article](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=1940831)], Faustin Ahishakiye et al.
  <details><summary>Dynamic data race detection techniques...</summary><p>...usually involve invasive instrumentation that makes it impossible to deploy an executable with such checking in the field, hence making errors difficult to debug and reproduce. This paper shows how to detect data races using the COEMS technology through continuous online monitoring with low-impact instrumentation on a novel FPGA-based external platform for embedded multicore systems. It is used in combination with formal specifications in the high-level stream-based temporal specification language TeSSLa, in which we encode a lockset-based algorithm to indicate potential race conditions. We show how to instantiate a TeSSLa template that is based on the Eraser algorithm, and present a corresponding light-weight instrumentation mechanism that emits necessary observations to the FPGA with low overhead. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with experimental results on detection of data races on a sample application.</p></details>
