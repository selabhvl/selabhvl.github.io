Software engineering and how we develop software play a still more critical role for system development as software technology is becoming pervasive across all areas of society and industry.
Software engineering is concerned with the concepts, principles, methods and software tools used in the design, implementation, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance of software and IT systems.

> Our research activities encompass theoretical foundations, software development tools and technology, and implementation and evaluation of software system prototypes.

The group has a particular strong research track record in the areas of model-driven software engineering, concurrent and distributed systems, software verification and testing, software quality and security, code refactoring, and software architecture.

Our research group is involved in several projects in the areas of health-care, embedded systems, robotics and industrial automation, internet-of-things and cloud computing services, machine learning, and automotive software systems.

Furthermore, we have research collaboration with many national and international research institutions, and several national and international companies:
the University of Extremadura (ES), the [University of L체beck (DE)](https://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de), University of Oslo (NO), [the University of Stavanger (NO)](https://www.ux.uis.no/~meling/), and [the University of Torino (IT)](https://www.cs.unito.it/do/home.pl).
