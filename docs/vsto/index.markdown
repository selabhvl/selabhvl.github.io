Hi, I'm professor in Software Engineering at the Høgskulen på Vestlandet (HVL).
You can download my [short CV](https://lambda.foldr.org/~vs/stolz-4p.pdf) here,
or visit [my static institutional page](https://www.hvl.no/person/?user=Volker.Stolz).

I'm also the study program coordinator ("*studieprogramkoordinator*") for our Bachelor program in [Information Technology](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/information-technology-bergen/) in Bergen, as well as the international exchange-coordinator.

Together with [Håkon Gylteryd](https://hakon.gylterud.net), I'm one of the two national management committee members of the [EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io) EU COST Action CA20111.

I am also a member of [Formal Methods Europe (FME)](https://www.fmeurope.org).

## Research Areas

* Refactoring
* Aggregate Programming
* Runtime Verification
* Software Engineering

## Publications

In [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/24/2502.html), in [Cristin](https://app.cristin.no/persons/show.jsf?id=1721) (Norwegian research database, includes pre-prints!).

## Teaching

* Mobile and distributed application development (Android, cross-platform, aggregate)
* Model-driven software engineering and reliable software systems
* Programming languages

## Side-projects

* I dabble in home automation with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), also from a perspective of software engineering for our IoT lab (BSc and MSc-projects)
* Some pet-projects are now on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/fm_volker/) instead of Github.com, like the scraping-tool to check the trash-pickup schedule in Bergen ([BIRscrape](https://codeberg.org/fm_volker/birscrape)).
