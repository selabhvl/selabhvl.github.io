[Dr. Muhammad Rizwan Ali (HVL)]({{ "/#Muhammad Rizwan Ali" | uri_escape }}) successfully defended his PhD thesis on "Formal Modelling and Analysis for Cross-organisational workflows"! Congratulations!

This marks a high-light for our NFR-funded project ["Croflow - Enabling Highly Automated Cross-Organisational Workflow Planning"](https://croflow.github.io) with the first PhD being somewhat involved in the project having graduated. [Violet as PI]({{"/#vpu"}}) of the project and Rizwan's main supervisor (with Yngve Lamo as co-supervisor) still has more exciting research in the pipeline.

That our confidence in Rizwan wasn't completely misplaced is substantiated by his post-graduation tool-paper that got accepted for FASE 2026 just a few days later.
As you know, reviewer #2 always would like some changes, so we'll catch up here with the final preprint after the holidays. Let's see who'll present their paper on "EasyRPL - A web-based tool for modelling and analysis of cross-organisational workflows" (with Violet and [Guillermo Román-Díez](https://costa.fdi.ucm.es/~groman/web/)) in Torino. You can try their web-based tool already now at: [https://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/rpltools/easyrpl/clients/web/](https://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/rpltools/easyrpl/clients/web/).

Congratulations from the whole Software Engineering group, Rizwan!
