Our own [Yngve Lamo]({{ "/#yla" | uri_escape }}) will be at the national ["Arendalsuka"](https://www.arendalsuka.no/programsok/details/24194) in the debate on "Digital Health in Analog Municipalities" (<em>Digital helse i analoge kommuner</em>).

Yngve has background (and opinions) on digital healthcare services, something he and other colleagues are working on here at [HVL](/).

The event should also be streamed on Tuesday, 2024-08-13 17:00 - 17:45, see the link at the top.

Given that this event is full of national and local political representatives, maybe Yngve can even find us some money that we desperately need (cuts despite increasing student numbers)...
