[Dr. Justus Sagemüller (HVL)](/#Justus Sagemüller) successfully defended his PhD thesis on "Paths Towards Reliable Explainability In Neural Networks for Image-Processing"! Congratulations!

Justus did a great job defending his work against Stephan Wäldchen & Yufei HAN, and we're very pleased that he already secured a post-doc position at KTH before defending. Nothing says "you're a good scientist" like a decent job-offer!

Justus' thesis monograph is not online yet, but you can read his scientific contribution to the Explainable Artificial Intelligence conference on [Ablation Path Saliency](https://app.cristin.no/results/show.jsf?id=2198271).

Please contact Justus if you don't subscribe to Springer's publications and would like a copy!

Justus' defense is very special for us as a research group, and for HVL &emdash; this completes the 15 PhD candidates that our PhD programme had promised to NOKUT in the given timeframe, and it is essential for HVL's application to full university status.
