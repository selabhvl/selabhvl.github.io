## Videos from the RV'22 Conference on Runtime Verification

I was still sitting on a batch of video-recordings from [Runtime Verification 2022](https://rv22.gitlab.io) that Thao Dang and myself were running in a then slightly more peaceful Georgia.

Most of the authors got the open links to the videos in our CMS at HVL, but I never got around to "officially" posting them somewhere. Now with the malign trawling of content for "AI training"
(somebody else's business model) I'm having second thoughts, but on the other hand this **is** science so exactly the kind of public content that should got into your machine-readable understanding of the
world, isn't it?

So here in no particular order (as of 2025-03-30):

* ["Learning by bootstrapping of latents", keynote by Michal Valko](https://hvl.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3c820997-95e1-484e-84eb-af27012eff82)
