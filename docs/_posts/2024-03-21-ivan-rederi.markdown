Together with our vice-dean for innovation [Øyvind M. Berge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/%C3%B8yvind-m-berge-0934617a_i-ettermiddag-har-v%C3%A5r-dyktige-nye-stipendiat-activity-7176641627883511808-0RRB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
our PhD student [Ivan Spajić]({{ "/#Ivan Spajić" | uri_escape }}) and [Volker Stolz](/#vsto) visited the Bergen Shipowners' Association ([Bergens Rederiforening](https://rederiforeningen.no)) to present our initial thoughts on his PhD project "Maritime Digital Twins".
We're very lucky that they're funding his PhD position, and we're still [looking for a PhD student that works on modelling and simulation of solid oxide fuel cell systems](https://www.jobbnorge.no/en/available-jobs/job/259315/phd-scholarship-in-modelling-and-simulation-of-solid-oxide-fuel-cell-systems-for-maritime-applica) who they're also funding.

Ivan has his work cut out for him, it seems everyone could (always!) need more IT, and Ivan will follow their suggestion of looking around what is actually going on on ships by sailing on the Stadsrad Lemkuhl to Shetland soon!
