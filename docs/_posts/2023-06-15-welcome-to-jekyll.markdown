With all the changes on social media such as Twitter and new federated options,
we've decided to try out something new and also get a bit more control about our content,
and also a more permanent home (or at least an archive) for our content.

We'll be moving away from our presence at <https://twitter.com/hibicteng>,
and we already have a new presence on Mastodon at <https://fediscience.org/@selabhvl>.
